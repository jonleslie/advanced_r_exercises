# 12 Base types

```{r}
library(sloop)
```

## Base versus OO objects
```{r}
# A base object:
is.object(1:10)
sloop::otype(1:10)

# An OO object
is.object(mtcars)
sloop::otype(mtcars)


```
Technically, the difference between base and OO objects is that the OO objects have a "class" attribute
```{r}
x <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
class(x)
attributes(x)
sloop::otype(x)

sloop::s3_class(x)
```
